# Implementation Plan - Startup Reality Engine

The **Startup Reality Engine** is a high-fidelity, analytical tool designed to evaluate startup ideas with brutal honesty and data-driven logic. This application will transition the evaluation logic into a premium web experience.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
- [ ] Initialize Vite + React (TypeScript) project.
- [ ] Set up **Vanilla CSS** with a premium design system (Glassmorphism, Dark Mode, Inter & Outfit fonts).
- [ ] Configure **Genkit** for formalizing the AI evaluation logic.
- [ ] Set up **Lucide React** for iconography.

## Phase 2: User Input Experience
- [ ] Build a sleek, multi-step form to collect startup details:
    - Idea / Problem Statement.
    - Target Audience & Differentiation.
    - Financials (Budget, Burn Rate).
    - Team Stats & Founder Skills (Interactive Sliders).
    - Market Context (Country, Industry, Competitors).
- [ ] Implement real-time validation and smooth transitions (Framer Motion).

## Phase 3: AI Evaluation Engine (Genkit)
- [ ] Define the `startupEvaluationFlow` in Genkit.
- [ ] Implement structured prompts based on the provided evaluation steps.
- [ ] Schema-driven results (Survival Odds, Failure Probabilities, Runway Calcs).

## Phase 4: Results Dashboard
- [ ] **Visual Reality Check**: Radial progress bars for survival odds.
- [ ] **Financial Runway Visualization**: Charting the burn rate vs. budget.
- [ ] **Competitive Matrix & Risk Breakdown**: Categorized threat analysis.
- [ ] **Strategic Advice**: Clear, actionable improvements.

## Phase 5: Polish & UX
- [ ] Add micro-animations for "Analyzing" state (simulating deep processing).
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile/desktop.
- [ ] Export as PDF/Shareable link (Optional/Future).
